    <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.

      Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

    <h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

      We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.

    <h2 id="security">Security</h2>

    <p>
      We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

      Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.

      While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

      If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at (111-222-3344) or via email.
